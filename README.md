# LulzMod CK2 for Princes of Darkness

The POD-compatible version of LulzMod for Crusader Kings II, it depends on **Princes of Darkness**, which can be found on both [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1333219891) and [Github](https://github.com/peregrine-collegia/POD/tree/master/Current). 

While it won't be updated anymore, it isn't fully deprecated yet, as I am yet to make a version for [the CK3 version of Princes of Darkness](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2216659254).
